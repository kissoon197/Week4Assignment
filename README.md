# Week4Assignment

The assignment for week 4
This is being completed at a later date since I wasn't very available to complete this assignment on week 4.
I did have a friend help me with this assignment when I got stuck. I got stuck frequently.

Despite much support from a friend online, neither of us could figure out how to escape issues when running the server and client.
When attempting to enter name and messages on the client side, there were errors that we spent a lot of time trying to fix.
There must have been an error somewhere along my methods to set up this assignment, and after spending a lot of time searching online as well, decided to give up.
